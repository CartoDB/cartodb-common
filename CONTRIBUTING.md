## Submitting contributions

Before opening a pull request (or submitting a contribution) you will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before making a submission, [learn more here](https://carto.com/contributions).

After that, there are several rules you should follow when a new pull request is created:

- Title has to be descriptive. If you are fixing a bug don't use the ticket title or number.
- Explain what you have achieved in the description and choose a reviewer (it has to be a CartoDB team member) of your code. If you have doubts, just ask for one.
- Every new feature (as well as bugfixes) should come with a test case.
- Our linter machine, [Hound](https://houndci.com/), should not trigger any warnings about your changes.
- All tests should pass.
